This is my first open source project hosted on GitHub.

Navigation Sidebar navigate view controllers through left-side menu like in Facebook, GMail and Path for iOS.
Menu can be shown by Pan (Drag) as well as by Swipe.
It can be hidden by tapping at small piece of view controller on the right or by swiping as well.

For convenience:
1) there is singleton accessible at [PSNavigationSidebar sharedNavigationSideBar]
2) there are 2 notification are being posted to NoficationCenter: "SidebarWillHide" and "SidebarWillShow" just before showing and hiding the sidebar
3) there are two methods for showing and hiding the sidebar:
	-(void)showNavigationSideBar;
	-(void)hideNavigationSideBar;

Sample usage:

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window = [[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] autorelease];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    
    UIViewController *controller1 = [[[UIViewController alloc] init] autorelease];
    controller1.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];
    controller1.title = @"Blue one";

    UIViewController *controller2 = [[[UIViewController alloc] init] autorelease];
    controller2.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    controller2.title = @"Green one";
    
    [[PSNavigationSidebar sharedNavigationSideBar] setViewControllers:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:controller1, controller2, nil]];
    
    self.window.rootViewController = [PSNavigationSidebar sharedNavigationSideBar];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
